# Research

At SUSTech, we pioneer a line of research grounded in insights from the space, and aimed at understanding atmospheric composition at various spatial and temporal scales. The importance of satellite observations for tropospheric chemistry is increasing, but the applications have been largely prevented by unquantified accuracy and unconfirmed consistency of the retrievals. Our research program combines remote sensing, modeling, and data assimilation techniques, making me in a unique position to bridge the gap between satellite observations and their broad applications. Our research focus on three objectives.

###1. Exploit satellite observations of trace gases for air quality applications

Observations of trace gases from space have changed the tropospheric chemistry research profoundly in the past two decades. Satellite-based retrievals provide continuous measurements on a global scale, and have been used extensively to understand chemical processes, to test emission inventories, to examine long-term trends, and to quantify health effects. However, retrievals produced by different research groups from different satellite sensors using different algorithms have received little validation and intercomparison so far. The accuracy and consistency of the retrievals remain largely unclear, which limits the applications for air quality studies.

We investigating new species such as BrO, glyoxal, methane, NH3, NO2, ozone, and SO2. These species play an important role in tropospheric chemistry. I plan to validate and intercompare tropospheric retrievals of these species on a global scale taking advantage of the recent leap in in-situ observations. Vertical profiles of these species have been measured in various aircraft campaigns worldwide in the past five years. In addition, data availability is rapidly expanding from the growing Pandora-based and Fourier-transform-infrared-based networks. I anticipate using a chemical transport model (CTM) GEOS-Chem at a high resolution (~ 12 km) as the intercomparison platform. Using this approach, satellite and in-situ observations do not need to be concurrent, thus increasing considerably the range of data and conditions that can be used for validation and intercomparison. The information obtained can be used to construct more reliable long-term trends, and in an iterative process to optimize retrieval settings and minimize biases. I am also willing to develop a chemical data assimilation framework that integrates satellite retrievals and model results to provide optimal estimates of atmospheric pollutants.

My early faculty years will coincide with arrival of early data from TROPOMI (launched Oct. 2017) and OMPS (Nov. 2017) and with the projected launch of a global geostationary constellation of satellites including GEMS (2018) over East Asia, TEMPO (2019) over North America, and Sentinel-4 (2020) over Europe. These instruments will observe atmospheric composition at much higher spatial and temporal resolution, offering a new perspective of the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry. Interpretation and implication of observations from these instruments will require quantification of uncertainties and biases. I am eager to be an early adopter of these datasets and member of the TEMPO Science Team working towards this goal.2 I will also use aircraft- and ground-based observations and participate in collaborative field campaigns to relate satellite observations to air quality at the surface.


Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high?

Currently, our instrument of choice  is SI-STM.  State-of-the-art SI-STM measures an array of tunneling spectra on a given sample, registered to the atomic sites with picometer precision. Each is proportional to the local density of states at a given location. Ideally, the recorded spectra are so tightly packed that the measurement yields a three-dimensional mapping of the local density of states as a function of locations and energy. This is shown on the image on the right-hand side (10x10 nm2), and its Fourier transform, below.

The quantum materials which we will investigate encapsulate some of the great unsolved mysteries of physics. They include high-temperature superconductors, quantum-critical compounds, graphene, and topological electronic matter that can be used for error-resistant quantum computing.

A main goal is to use modern technology to build the new instrumentation needed to understand these quantum materials. I learned my trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where we investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. This allowed me to learn new techniques such as high frequency measurements, low temperature noise-free amplification, and quantum-limited measurements. The goal is to combine these with SI-STM.

This will enable the instrumental capabilities to visualize the different quantum mechanical degrees of freedom needed to understand next-generation quantum materials. STM will be the main method, but we use different spectroscopic-imaging techniques to visualize not only the topography, but also the density of states, spins, and other degrees of freedom hidden below the surface.
